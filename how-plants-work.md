How Plants Work
===============

Light
-----

Photoperiodism - Depending on the length of darkness in order to flower
  * Short day plants - Flower when there is a longer period of darkness
  * Long day plants - Flower when there is a shorter period of darkness
  * Day neutral plants - Flower when the plants get to a certain body size

Plants respond to a spectrum of 300nm - 750nm, sensed in all cells.

13 photoreceptors:
  * Blue spectrum:
    * UVB Receptor - Detect UV light
    * Phototropin 1 & 2 - 
    * Cryptochrome 1 & 2 - Regulates biological clock, useful for seedling development
    * Chlorophyll 1 & 2
    * Zeitlupe

  * Red spectrum:
    * Chlorophyll 1 & 2
    * Phytochrome A, B, C, D & E

Plant responses to light:
  * Phototropism - Plant response to blue light. The plant absorbs blue light and bends towards it. It is the tip of the plant which perceives the light signal. (Darwin cap experiment)
  * Shade avoidance - Elongation of its stem to find a reliable light source
  * Photoperiodism - Transition to flowering
  * Germination
  * Seedling development

Phytochrome - Light activated switch. Pf -> Pfr (Red -> Far red)

Phosphorylation
  * A protein on the cell's membrane can become phosphorylated, so phosphate is added to the protein.
  * Is one of the ways proteins signal to each other

Photomorphogenesis

Stomata - Holes on the leaves where the plant breathes

Blue light effects:
  * Phototropism
  * Opening of stomata
  * Chloroplasts moving through the cell
  * Leaves following the sun during the day

Light signaling

Arabidopsis thaliana - Plant with whole lifecycle of 8 weeks. Used in several labs among the world. It has a very small genome.

Hypocotyl - Stem
Cotyledon - Set of first leaves


Smell
-----

Ethylene - Emitted from the fruit when it is ripening, it triggers ripening on other fruits
Senescence - When a plant's leaves or petals drop (leaf abscission). It is triggered by ethylene

Salicylic acid - Immune response hormone in plants, dissolves in water
Metyl-Salicylic acid - Volatile Salicylic acid (dissolves in air)


Touch
-----

Action Potential - Ions get through a cell/neuron membrane to create an electric potential, which is a signal

Thigmonasty - Plant movement in response to mechanical stimulation (eg. mimosa)
Thigmomorphogenesis - Plants permanent response to mechanical stimulation (eg. cocklebur)

25K genes in each plant cell - Only some genes are turned on, maybe by internal signals, or external signals


Other senses
------------

Proprioception - the ability to sense the position, orientation and movement of the body and its parts
Circumnutation - Inherent feature of all plants where they rotate through different speeds, periods and shapes. Its period and speed is determined by gravitropism.

Gravitropism - Response to change of orientation in relation to gravity
 - Roots are positively gravitropic: Grow against the gravity vector
 - Shoots are negatively gravitropic: Grow towards the gravity vector
 + Sensed by some cells at the tip of the roots using an organelle called Amytoplasts, which accummulates starch and fall towards gravity, sensing it.
 + Gravitropism is independent from roots to stems

 Hormone effects matter on:
  - Location
  - Timing
  - Concentration

Auxin - The first plant hormone to be isolated. It is used to stimulate growth by elongating the plant cells
 * High concentrations - Inhibits elongation
 * Low concentrations - Induces elongation
 + It is produced at the shoot (tip) and transported to the roots

Auxin functions:
  + Growth
  + Phototropism
  + Gravitropism
  + Branching
  + Seed development
  + Meristem development
  + Initiation of roots
  + Cell elongation



Memory
------

Short term - potential over a threshold

Morphogenetic memory - A type of memory that later influenes the shape of the plant.

Vernalization - Transition through winter allowing plants to flower. Tricked by placing the seeds in a refrigerator before planting.

Epigenetic changes - Some genes are activated or deactivated and passed on to the offspring.

There are three types of memories, according to Endel Turving
  * Procedural - Anoetic
    - Nonverbal rememberings on how to do things
    - Dependent on sensing external stimulation
  * Semantic - Noetic
    - Memory of concepts
  * Episodic - Autonoetic
    - Autobiographical events
    - Dependent on the self-awareness
