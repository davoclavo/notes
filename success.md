You have to create some discipline. Teach yourself to listen to yourself, make some rules that don't necessarily make sense, and follow them. For instance, tell yourself that that paper has to be done within 3 days (even though you actually still have a week) I had to do this too to study in university. I needed to study books while my exams were months away, there was no real pressure... so I just kept a small schedule, told myself "to get chapter two done today"
